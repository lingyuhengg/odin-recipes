        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Prepare Chicken and Rice</h3></li>
            Wash the rice until the water runs clear. In a separate bowl, season the chunks of chicken with salt and 2 tablespoons of cajun seasoning. 
            <li><h3>Saute Sausage</h3></li>
            Set the Instant Pot to "Saute" and heat up 2 tablespoons of neutral oil. Once hot, add the sausage and stir until brown. Transfer the sausage to a bowl and set it aside. 
            <li><h3>Saute Remaining Ingredients</h3></li>
            Add the remaining dry ingredients (apart from the rice and chicken) and seasonings into the Instant Pot. Keep the Instant Pot on "Saute" and stir frequently for about 5 minutes or until the ingredients are slightly softened. 
            <li><h3>Add Chicken, Rice, and Broth</h3></li>
            Add the chicken, rice, and broth into the Instant Pot and stir to combine. Select "Cancel" on the Instant Pot and seal the lid. Set it to "Pressure Cook" on High for 8 minutes, and leave it for 10 minutes after the cooking is done. After that, release the reamining steam. 
            <li><h3>Serve</h3></li>
            Remove the lid and fluff the rice. Add and mix in the cooked sausage into the rice. It can then be served topped with scallions and any hot sauce of choice. 
        </ol>
